                            <b>EMPTY STREETS</b> is a fragment from a song called "Finally An Empty Street" written in the mid-2000s with a few close friends. The song is probably about different things for different people, but for me it's about <span class="highlighter">movement</span>: from one part to another, and into a wall of noise where beautiful harmonics emanate from the collective dissonance beyond the stave. Maybe it's also about traffic or apocalypse, but the name feels like an opening in the grid, a space to think through P≈ç and Ao in the ever-transformative archipelago.    

<p>I find myself working more with old friends these days, a stroke of luck in an sea of possibility. Like before, we work in images, musical instruments and microphones; amplification and serenity; in the expanse that belongs to Pele and Poli'ahu, Kanaloa and concrete. Our struggle is our organization.
