<p>From a small city in Northwest Japan, where I teach courses in <span class="highlighter">visual politics, social movements, and indigenous studies</span>, I can appreciate <span class="highlighter">Pablo Helguera's work on "socially-engaged art,"</span> though its often recycled here in the context of regional development (地域振興), but also for thinking about where one practices. Helguera explores SEA as "a form of performance in the expanded field," which blends well with the fieldwork politics of ethnographers like Michael Taussig, but also artists like Apichatpong Weerasethakul who spend long periods of time in community spaces as a way to elicit participation of those who lack access to their own documentation. In this social - political nexus (a dinosaur egg), documentary and fiction accompany a series of performative and critical engagements with "fields" that are extremely different. My experience is based in the archipelagic sense of being a Kanaka Maoli (living outside of Hawai'i), but also a project collaborator for over ten years in the Thai borderlands, and a devotee to the interpretive and political possibilities of documentary film.   

    Invited to the Thai-Malay borderlands by a close friend who spent his artist-in-residence in Hawai'i in 2011, I would make numerous trips to Thailand's restive martial law provinces between 2015 and 2019. Working in a variety of tasks that included poetry translation, audio recording and short film production, I sought to explore the possibilities of social practice in the production of a collaborative work. In many cases, the idea of a field and a space of exhibition seemed to converge. In Narathiwat and Pattani, Thailand's majority Muslim provinces, art galleries almost always serve social functions at least as much as they serve symbolic ones tied to the exhibition of artist works. As day-to-day cafes, spaces of mourning, educational centers, and multi-purpose halls,

    <p>In the everyday landscapes of the Hawai'i pae 'Aina, statues, street names and murals attest to intersections of the actual and the symbolic, as much as a a recent exhibition of the films of Na Maka O Ka Aina at the State Museum exhibits the convergence of activism and the apparatus of film and art. In 2013, Puhipau and Joan Lander (Nā Maka O Ka ʻĀina) hosted a workshop for my political theory students at UH-Hilo. Each of the students would engage the medium in a community issue of their choosing as a way of critiquing the materialization of ideology in local context. In their short films, we can see social expression layered in the realm of the symbolic. Students who went out to film the contested TMT permit hearings, or observe the rituals of the Merrie Monarch Hula competition that semester were sure to recognize the interplay of signs, songs, and language in a specific time of protest. These beautiful memories link to an extensive record of indigenous voice.    

<p>In Japan, my courses draw from my collaborative social practice in the borderlands and depth of community engagement experienced in Hawaiʻi. My courses in Visual Politics and Social Movements, explore local "modes of production" that range from the visualization of place in creative media to the networks of collaboration that link administrative policy with the transformation of traditional life (from the actual rebranding of local commodities to an authorized performance of a fictional political party in one of Japan's most dominant commercial spaces--Aeon Mall). To augment my classes, we recently inaugurated a student living space (Indigenous House) organized and programmed around indigenous advocacy. The house was inspired by experience advising students from Ainu and Ryukyu backgrounds and the need to program a more complex linking between indigenous practices in Japan (which remain marginal) and those of other Pacific Islands familiarized through transnational networks of tourism and histories of war.
