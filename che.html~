		  width=320" height="200"> <p> Zakariya Amataya (better known as Che) moved to Bangkok for high school, and lived there for over two decades. He is editing his third poetry collection while adapting to new challeges since returning home in 2015. One challenge, to expand intellectual production in the Southern border region, began to take shape in a yearly literary magazine called <i>The Melayu Review</i>. In this collaborative pursuit, Che joins with local community organizations to organize writing workshops and critical debate to rebuild a space that has, since the imposition of martial law in 2004, experienced significant restrictions on political speech.</p>
