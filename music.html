    <h2><span class="shadow">"Privatization in Nigeria is selling the 
Government to individuals. And with  the debt equity swap, the World Bank is ruining my country with what it owns; it means my country is on the market. I've never seen that before, historically. It's happening in Nigeria, Ghana, and these leaders accept this arrangement. Which makes me feel that they are agents for the Western system: they do everything, they have the guns to persecute, and people become poorer and poorer, which is making life difficult for Africans."</h2>

   <center> <span class="shadow">10 Ways that You Can Make Music A Political Act</span></center> <br>


    	<p>
	1. Consider the role of music in <span class="shadow">society</span>:  Rhythm and harmony are the metronome of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27378620_Plato_and_Aristotle_On_Music_and_Music_Education_Lessons_From_Ancient_Greece">subjectivity.</a> (Plato)
	<p>

	2. Challenge the rules, as <span class="shadow">musical notation</span> is political. (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3654140?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>) We can change that (e.g., by making it easier for others to "read" music).

	<p>
	3. <span class="shadow">Democratize the stage</span>: create the conditions for fans and audiences to become part of the song. (Apichatpong Weerasethakul does this with cinema in the 2000 film <i>Mysterious Object at Noon</i>) 

	<p>    
	4. Create a <span class="shadow">music wing</span> within an existing social movement.

	<p>	    
	5.<span class="shadow">Sing more! Or make it possible for others to sing more.</span> John Street writes that a song of resistance is political "in the mere act of singing." (p. 44)

	<p>	    
	6.<span class="shadow">Explore music about your region</span> as a way to sustain local/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVuvKIFa6kc">indigenous</a> cultures.  

	    <p>
	7. Utilize music as <span class="shadow">"a form of reporting"</span> (See Street 2011, p. 48)		

	<p>
	8. The personal is political. <span class="shadow">Document your political awakening</span> in music. Which songs or  musical events (<a href="images/mtmf1.png">1</a>,<a href="images/mtmf2.png">2</a>) would you share?

	<p>	    
	    9. <span class="shadow">DIY: Grab the nearest musical instrument</span> and make your message either as loud or clear as possible. <i>Keep in mind, many bands were terrible musicans (e.g., The Ramones, and/or just about every other punk band of the late 70s). But the whole, says Aristotle, is greater than th sum of its parts.</i>
