<h3><span class="shadow">Between the corridors
<br>And this white room of cables
<br>The smell of ammonia permeates the air
<br>The vital signs monitor reverberates
<br>Amid quickened protocols and shouts
<br>I am stuck to this bed
<br>You see me
<br>I struggle against the fade to black
<br>From the force that made my brain swell
<br>Perhaps an accidental slip
<br>In the final release from confinement
<br>Or maybe from something that escapes your memory

<p> Zakariya Amataya lived in the capital city for over two decades before returning home in 2015.  He is currently at work in  editing his third poetry collection while actively engaged in Thailand's Southern border region, especially with a yearly literary magazine called <i>The Melayu Review</i>. In this collaborative pursuit, Che joins with local community organizations to organize writing workshops and critical debate to rebuild a space that has, since the imposition of martial law in 2004, experienced significant restrictions on political speech.</p>
