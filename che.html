<h2><span class="shadow"><u>Documentary Film Project</u>: <i>WRITERS</i></span></h2>
<u>Primary Location</u>: Narathiwat, Thailand
 
<p><span class="shadow"><b>EDITOR</b>: <i>The Melayu Review</i></span>


<p class="text-monospace nbody"><span class="shadow "> Zakariya Amataya won the Southeast Asia Writers Award (or, SEAWrite) in 2010 for the trilingual poetry collection <i> No Woman in Poetry</i> (2010) and went to Hawaii as an artist-in-residence at the Doris Duke Shangri La Museum of Art, Culture and Design. In Hawaii, I started to document his journey and the  mutual love for the sea that inspired his second collection, <i>If as Deep as the Ocean Within Us</i> (2013).     When he finally returned home to the southern border region in 2015, after living in Thailand's capital city for over two decades, I followed with my camera. At work with his third poetry collection, he manages a literary and intellectual  yearbook from the region called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MelayuReview/">The Melayu Review</a>. As a collaborative pursuit, Che partners with community organizations to organize writing workshops and grassroots media channels to help rebuild a space that has, since the imposition of martial law in 2004, experienced significant restrictions on political speech. The documentary is about the challenges and possibilities of his pursuit.</span></p>
