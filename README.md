# POLIS
This site was devised as a way to link fieldwork and ongoing research projects with my university teaching. It has three primary dimensions:

1. A broad application of so-called political theory with contemporary events.

2. The application of visual politics to everyday forms of empowerment.

3. Lecture snippets that may be of use to student projects.
