# RESONANT BODIES
This site is a kind of scratchpad for linking fieldwork and ongoing research projects with my university teaching. It has three primary dimensions:

1. A broad application of critical theory with contemporary events.

2. The application of visual and open-source tools to everyday forms of empowerment.

3. Snippets/class examples for student projects.
