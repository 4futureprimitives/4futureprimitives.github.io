# POLIS
This site was devised as a way to link fieldwork and ongoing research projects with my university teaching. It has three primary dimensions:

1. A broad application of critical theory with contemporary events.

2. The application of visual and open-source tools to everyday forms of empowerment.

3. Lecture/tutorial snippets that may be of use to student projects.
